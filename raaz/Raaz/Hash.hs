{-|

This module exposes all the hash functions provided by the raaz
library. This is the interface that you would normally want to
use. You can also import the module for the individual hash function.

The constructors of the hash types are not exposed here; we expect the
user to use these types as an opaque type so as to get the benefits of
type checking. However, if you want to get the constructor for any of
the hash Foo you could import the module Raaz.Hash.Foo.Type.
